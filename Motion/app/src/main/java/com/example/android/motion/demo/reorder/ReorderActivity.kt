     * a `CoordinatorLayout` holding an `AppBarLayout` (which holds a [Toolbar] widget) and a
     * [RecyclerView] which uses a `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` as its layout manager.
     *
     * We initialize our [Toolbar] variable `val toolbar` by finding the view with ID `R.id.toolbar`
     * and our [RecyclerView] variable `val list` by finding the view with ID `R.id.list`. We use the
     * [setSupportActionBar] method to set `toolbar` to act as the ActionBar for our activity's
     * window, then call our [EdgeToEdge.setUpRoot] to configure the view with ID `R.id.root` (the
     * root `CoordinatorLayout` of our layout file) for edge to edge display, call our [EdgeToEdge.setUpAppBar]
     * method to configure our app bar with ID `R.id.app_bar` and our [Toolbar] toolbar for edge to
     * edge display, and call our [EdgeToEdge.setUpScrollingContent] method to configure our
     * [RecyclerView] `list` for edge to edge display. We then initialize our field [pickUpElevation]
     * to the dimension stored in our resources under the ID `R.dimen.pick_up_elevation` (8dp) and
     * add an [RecyclerView.ItemDecoration] to `list` consisting of a [SpaceDecoration] whose value
     * is stored under the ID `R.dimen.spacing_small` in our resources (8dp).
     *
     * Next we initialize our [ItemTouchHelper] variable `val itemTouchHelper` to a new instance that
     * will work with our [ItemTouchHelper.Callback] field [touchHelperCallback] (this handles view
     * drag inside a [RecyclerView]), and then use the `attachToRecyclerView` method of `itemTouchHelper`
     * to attach it to our [RecyclerView] `list`.
     *
     * Next we initialize our [CheeseGridAdapter] variable `val adapter` with an instance constructed
     * to use a lambda for its [CheeseGridAdapter.onItemLongClick] field which calls the `startDrag`
     * method of `itemTouchHelper` to start dragging the `itemView` of the [RecyclerView.ViewHolder]
     * that the user chooses when it is long-pressed ([CheeseGridAdapter.onItemLongClick] is set to
     * be the `OnLongClickListener` of all of the `itemView` displayed by the [RecyclerView]). We
     * set the `adapter` of `list` to the `adapter` constructed above.
     *
     * Finally we add an observer to the [ReorderViewModel.cheeses] field of [viewModel] whose lambda
     * will submit the changed list of [Cheese] objects to `adapter` to be diffed and displayed (every
     * time the items are reordered on the screen, the lambda will receive a new list, and the adapter
     * takes a diff between the old and the new lists, and animates any moving items by the
     * [RecyclerView.ItemAnimator] of `list` which is `DefaultItemAnimator` in our case).
